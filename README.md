👋 Hi, I’m Dimitris!

👀 I’m a backend enthusiast with a love for Java, relational databases, and crafting smooth systems using Spring Boot.

🌱 Right now, I’m on a journey to master microservices architecture while building a full-stack ecommerce app—one API at a time!

💞️ I’d love to collaborate on anything Java-related, from scalable microservices to clever Spring Boot tricks.

📫 Feel free to reach out here on GitHub or through jimisp97@gmail.com.
